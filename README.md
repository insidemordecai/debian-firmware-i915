`Add these to /lib/firmware/i915`

This repo provides the files for module i915 firmware for Kali Linux. This is for those who might be missing the required firmware.

For other kinds of linux, firmware binaries are available on the linux-firmware repository, so it is most likely your current Linux distribution already packages them.  Please check with your Linux distribution to see what is currently included.
